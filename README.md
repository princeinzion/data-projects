# Netflix Movie Analysis
This repository contains a Python script dedicated to analyzing Netflix movie data. The main focus of the analysis is to explore movie durations over the years, with insights on if the average duration of movies has been declining.

## Key Features:
1. **Data Loading**: Reads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleans and preprocesses the data, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Contains scatter plots visualizing movie durations over the years. Points in the scatter plot are color-coded based on the genre of the movie, highlighting "Children" movies distinctly.
4. **Interactivity**: Potential future work can extend the project to include interactive plots or dashboards.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib).
3. Run the Python script.
4. Visualize the output plots and gain insights into Netflix movie durations and their distribution across genres.
